# R code for "On the robustness and precision of mixed-model analysis of covariance incluster-randomized trials"


This repo stores the code for simulation and data analysis in the paper "On the robustness and precision of mixed-model analysis of covariance incluster-randomized trials", where we compare the mixed-model unadjusted estimator, mixed-model ANCOVA estimator, cluster-level unadjusted estimator, and cluster-level ANCOVA estimator.
- __data-analysis.R__ contains the code for re-anlayzing three cluster randomized trials.
- __simulation1.R__, __simulation2.R__, and __simulation3.R__ correspond to Scenarios 1,2, and 3 of our simulation sutdy, resepectively. 

All data used for demonstration are publicly available:
