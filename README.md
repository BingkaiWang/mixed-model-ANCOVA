# R code for "On the mixed-model analysis of covariance in cluster-randomized trials"


This repo stores the code for simulation and data analysis in the paper "On the mixed-model analysis of covariance in cluster-randomized trials", where we compare the mixed-model unadjusted estimator, mixed-model ANCOVA estimator, cluster-level unadjusted estimator, and cluster-level ANCOVA estimator.
- __data-analysis.R__ contains the code for re-analyzing three cluster randomized trials.
- __simulation1.R__ and __simulation2.R__ correspond to the first and second simulation study, respectively. 

All data used for demonstration are publicly available:
